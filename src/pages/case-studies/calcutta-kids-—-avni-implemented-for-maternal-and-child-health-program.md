Calcutta Kids is a public health organization providing health services to the underserved women and young children in the Kolkata slum area of Fakir Bagan. They provide preventive services, complemented by effective curative care when required, and carried out primarily by trained Community Health Workers (CHW). Calcutta Kids (CK) provides a whole range of services for women health, pregnancy and child health — which has been very well detailed here. CK runs a comprehensive program where **continuous service** is provided to their clients.

Until two years back CK was using a data management system (MIS) that captured complete data of the services delivered in the program. The MIS was also used to generate the schedule of work for CHWs, derive programmatic insights and prepare reports.

The MIS in use was a custom solution, i.e. developed specifically for CK. The system required adapting to the latest on-ground modifications to the program functioning and generation of new reports. This required CK to arrange for funds to continuously upkeep the system. The MIS was not a generic product and required development effort, hence was expensive. Apart from these, there was another major issue — the system was not accessible to the CHWs in the field. The benefits of having an on-field app is explained later.

**Data migration**\
One of the challenges of migrating from one system to another is to bring along all the data to the new system. Data migration in simple scenarios involves providing data to the new system in the format that it can accept. In data migration that involves a lot of tables, columns and rows, it is difficult to prepare data in the expected format manually, because the data-formats of the new system is completely different from the old system.\
Avni uses a way by which one can define mapping between data formats of the two systems. Currently, this mapping can be done only in an excel file, not via a user interface.

**Modelling CK programs onto Avni**\
In Avni, one can define multiple programs each of which can have their own encounter/visit types (with forms for each type) and a programmable schedule of visit. Three programs were defined — pregnancy, child and mother. A woman can be moved between mother and pregnancy program depending on whether they pregnant or not. A child can be enrolled in the child program at birth or if they come newly into Fakir Bagan (program area). Program feature in Avni allows for modularisation as it exists in the real world too.

**How does having an app in the field help CHWs?**\
CHWs at CK, completely did away with the paper forms. This allows for program designers to ensure that each interaction of the beneficiary with CHW can be modelled into the app — to ensure service quality. In Avni,— the CHW’s interaction with beneficiary is supported via a designed form flow that brings up only the right questions, right counselling topics, displays necessary computed information (e.g. referral advice based on complete data), and highlights data input mistakes.

**How does having a generic product like Avni, help CK?**\
Avni reduces the software development cost to the minimum for any of its implementations. Most changes in real-world program can be easily implemented via data changes — which doesn’t require costly software development projects. For example — adding a new encounter/visit type with form, is mostly a matter of using the form-designer via the web browser interface.
