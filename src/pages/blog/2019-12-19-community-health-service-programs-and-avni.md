  Many NGOs in India provide community health service via community health
  workers (CHWs). These health workers are the backbone of the community health
  systems. CHWs work is quite complex and Avni helps in making their work
  easier. This blog will cover what Community health, Community health service
  is and how Avni helps.

## **Community health**

There are three health related challenge faced by people living in rural villages:

1. physical access to health services
2. money to access these services
3. knowledge of when and how to do so

(if we think about urban slums, the first one is mitigated to great extent but other two are not). The idea of community health is to tackle all three (or two) of these - to the extent possible. Many health NGOs in India do this - under what is broadly understood as community health service.

## **Community health service**

In both rural and urban context, NGOs at the core achieve this as follows:

1. Employ* community health workers (CHWs) - who are then assigned a few villages/slums. These CHWs are trained for health work like - checking BP/weight/temperature/etc; explaining how to prescribed drugs; counselling people; identifying common risks based on symptoms; basic architecture of the health system; so on.
2. CHWs perform activities like - screening for common diseases, referring people to health system, following up after doctor's visit, home visit for basic checkup, etc.
3. Have program coordinators who support and supervise the CHWs by monitoring their work.
4. (often) In rural setup run a community hospital by themselves. In urban context this is usually not necessary given the transportation to clinics, hospitals is not an issue.

By bringing many simple health services closer to the people, they make the health system **accessible** (1) and CHWs bridge the **knowledge gap** (3). These services are provided at affordable prices (3) by the NGO. In urban setup 

NGOs run multiple health programs simultaneously via the CHWs based on age, gender and health conditions (e.g. maternal health, cancer screening, malaria testing, tuberculosis treatment adherence etc).

## **Avni helps in improving the quality of service**

The intersection of three factors contribute to the complexity of work performed by CHWs in the field.

* Avni allows the CHW to manage all this data via a mobile application, while being in the field.
* The design of app is such that the process of capturing the data and providing the service are intertwined with each other. This allows Avni to be tool that can guide the CHW in providing the service. The guidance is not restricted to just forms - but also in when/how to counsel and checklist of tasks. (See diagram below).
* Avni understands the programs and their protocol of visit. The app schedules the future visits and CHW can access their schedule of work - to make sure they are not missing out on any task or beneficiary.
