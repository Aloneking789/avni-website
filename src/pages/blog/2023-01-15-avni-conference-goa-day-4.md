This is the first day of our Goa conference where the Avni team interacted with our clients. The conference was scheduled at 9.30 am. Before that, we optimised our enthusiasm with an early morning beach walk and an equal heartwarming breakfast.

Also, the Avni team decided to wear a Goan outfit, so I and Nupur went shopping and bought a Goan floral print shirts.

### Set the context(Intros and context)
Arjun Khandelwal from team Avni kickstarted the session with an introduction. He gave a brief about the agenda for the conference. Then he spoke about last year's journey of Avni in short. And open the session for the introduction of our clients and Avni members. This was the first time when we all (team & clients)are under one roof. Many of us meet for the first time in person out of the small screens of our laptops.
