# Jal Jeevan Mission – Arghyam  
**Nov 2024**

The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), launched by the Government of India in 2019, aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections to every rural household by 2024. At its inception, only 3.23 crore (17%) rural households had tap water connections, but the mission has set an ambitious goal of adding nearly 16 crore additional households, benefiting over 19 crore rural families. As of August 2024, JJM has achieved significant progress, providing tap water connections to 11.82 crore more rural households, raising total coverage to over 15.07 crore households, or 77.98% of all rural households. The mission emphasizes a community-based approach, encouraging local ownership through contributions of cash, kind, or labor (shramdaan) and prioritizes sustainable water supply systems, infrastructure functionality, and resource maintenance. Additionally, it focuses on developing skilled human resources in construction, plumbing, water quality management, and catchment protection, creating a lasting impact on health, quality of life, and rural empowerment.

Arghyam supports JJM’s objectives in partnership with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and government departments, working to establish sustainable water supply systems across Indian states. With JJM’s remarkable national coverage expansion from 16% to over 78%, Arghyam has aligned its efforts through three thematic divisions: **Operations & Maintenance**, **Water Quality**, and **Source Sustainability**. These areas of focus help ensure the longevity and quality of rural water systems. Additionally, Arghyam runs the **India Water Portal (IWP)**, an online platform providing a space for academia, researchers, and practitioners to share insights, foster public discourse, and address issues in water, sanitation, and climate change, further advancing the mission’s transformative impact on India’s rural landscape.

Currently, three states in India are being focused on through projects that are developed based on geohydrological contexts as well as the priorities and approach of these state governments regarding water supply and management in rural areas.

| Sl No | State       | Thematic Focus Area     |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1     | Assam       | Water Quality          |
| 2     | Bihar       | O&M                    |
| 3     | Karnataka   | Source Sustainability  |

Besides these thematic priorities and focused geographies, Arghyam’s strategy is aimed at working at scale by leveraging technology as an enabler and integrating robust social processes to strengthen the system. Each of the Arghyam projects is designed with digital deployment and tech innovation as the mainstay of the intervention.

## Data Collection Method  
**Avni** is an open-source task tracker tool, which has been developed by Samanvay – Learning and Development Foundation. The tool has been used in different sectors, such as education and health, especially by frontline functionaries such as ASHA, teachers, CSO workers, and program managers to deliver and monitor their programmes across multiple states of India.

In Bihar, Avni has been rolled out by Arghyam partner agency **Aga Khan Rural Support Programme India (AKRSP-I)** to track the mandated tasks at the pipe water supply level by its PWS operators, also known as **Anurakshak/Pump-operator**. Through the Avni app, five tasks are being captured at PWS (pipe water supply system) by Anuarakshak, which are as follows:

### Tank Cleaning  
**Purpose:** To document the regular cleaning of water tanks, which is essential for maintaining water quality and safety.  
**Data Collected:**  
- Date of tank cleaning  
- Notification to the community about cleaning (photo)  
- Tank cleaning process (photos)  
- WIMC (Ward Implementation & Management Committee) members’ participation (photos)  
- Additional comments if needed  
**Frequency:** Biannual  
**Importance:** Ensures tanks are cleaned on schedule, the community is informed and involved, and records are digitized safely.  

### WIMC Meeting (Record Keeping)  
**Purpose:** To keep track of WIMC meetings, attendance, and key discussions, which foster community participation in water management.  
**Data Collected:**  
- Meeting date  
- Meeting attendance with photo evidence  
- Meeting minutes (photo of register)  
- Total attendance and female attendance count  
- Additional comments  
**Frequency:** Monthly  
**Importance:** Highlights community participation and the engagement of both male and female members in water management decisions.  

### Jal Chaupal Record Keeping  
**Purpose:** To document community gatherings (Jal Chaupal) that discuss water issues, providing a platform for feedback and ideas from locals.  
**Data Collected:**  
- Date of Jal Chaupal  
- Attendance (photo and count)  
- Proceedings (photo)  
- Breakdown of participants by total count and female count  
- Attendance of specific officials and community representatives  
- Additional comments  
**Frequency:** As organized by the community  
**Importance:** Ensures transparency and inclusiveness, showing that community feedback is formally acknowledged.  

### Log Book  
**Purpose:** To log daily details on water supply, noting any interruptions and reasons for service disruptions.  
**Data Collected:**  
- Date  
- Reporting month  
- Days of “no water supply”  
- Reasons for interruptions (such as power issues, pipeline breakage)  
- Monthly logbook photo  
**Frequency:** Monthly  
**Importance:** Ensures that all disruptions are recorded and analyzed, which can guide future improvements and maintenance actions.  

### Water Quality Testing  
**Purpose:** To monitor water quality by testing for chemical and biological contaminants, ensuring the safety of drinking water.  
**Data Collected:**  
- Dates of entry, sample collection, and testing  
- Sampling points (source, household, institution, etc.)  
- Chemical parameters: pH, Total Hardness, Alkalinity, Chloride, Nitrate, Arsenic, Fluoride, Iron  
- Biological parameter: Bacteriological contamination  
**Frequency:** As per the testing schedule  
**Importance:** Provides critical data on water safety, enabling quick responses to contamination issues and ensuring compliance with health standards.
