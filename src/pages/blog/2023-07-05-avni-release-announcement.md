Release 3.40.0 is now live.  

## Notable Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Media Viewer
The web console has a new member - Media Viewer !!!
The Media Viewer helps view all the media that you have uploaded in the app - pics, videos etc, and lets you filter and download these images in bulk. It is available for all organisation admins on organisations that have enabled analytics. Media will be available under one hour after upload to the Avni server.

See the [documentation](https://avni.readme.io/docs/media-viewer) for more details. Please take a look, and provide feedback. If you see anything missing, you can report it [here](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-media/issues).
