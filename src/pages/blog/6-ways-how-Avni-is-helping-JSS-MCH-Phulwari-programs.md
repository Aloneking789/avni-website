At [Jan Swasthya Sahyog](http://www.jssbilaspur.org/), we run multiple programs under our community health project in 70 villages in Bilaspur district.
Among those programs are MCH and Phulwari. MCH (Maternal and Child Health) programme is aimed at reducing maternal and infant mortality rates by providing quality and comprehensive antenatal care, intrapartum, postpartum mother care, home-based neonatal care in programme villages. Phulwari is a programme aimed at preventing and addressing malnutrition among the children under 3 years and help their older sibling go back to school. We do this through rural creches where we provide the children nutritious food and a stimulating environment for learning and development.

We started using Avni for our MCH (Maternal and Child Health) and Phulwari (rural creche) programs. This is how it is helping us. 

### 1. Instant data, decision support and reminders

 The android app is available in Hindi with decision support at various places while entering the data into the app. 

Earlier Phulwari supervisors had to refer to the gradation chart to know which child is in which nutritional grade. Now, the app calculates the z-score and tells the Phulwari supervisors nutritional grade of children and hence helps in the management of nutrition.

Likewise, the app is helping MCHW in identifying the sepsis in newborn, identifying high-risk pregnancies based on various data entered which is otherwise done by their field coordinators. Thanks to the highlighting of abnormal data fields, the MCHWs can easily identify high-risk conditions and take action.

While sharing their experiences on the use of Avni app our MCH workers (MCHWs) and Phulwari supervisors mention that *they feel empowered by using innovative technology in their work and they feel excited as they can now pull up real-time status reports of any pregnant women, newborn and under three years child.*  They can now track high-risk pregnancies very easily with the help of App and can provide continuous monitoring to such cases.

### 2. Efficient workforce supervision

Avni highlights overdue visits and cancelled visits along with reasons for cancelling the visits. Program coordinators can pull this data in to monitor phulwari supervisors more easily. No missed visit goes unnoticed.

### 3. No more maintaining and carrying paper registers

![JSSCP Paper Registers](/img/6-ways-how-Avni-is-helping-JSS-MCH-Phulwari-programs/JSSCP_paper_registers.jpg "JSSCP Paper Registers")

   Earlier MCHWs had to maintain physical registers and paper records. They had to carry this to their meetings with respective beneficiaries and meetings with supervisors. They also had to periodically hand them over to a data entry operator to digitise this data into excel sheets.
 
   Paper registers were bulky to carry, required multiple entries, and eventually, we still had to enter parts of it into excel sheets for reports. A lot of this cruft has now been eased. 

### 4. Eliminated the delays and errors due to a workflow involving data entry operator  
Earlier field workers used to bring and handover physical registers to a data entry operator stationed at our headquarters. The data entry operator would then put this data into excel sheets. Despite the best efforts by everyone, this process involved errors and delays. Now this workflow is eliminated as the data is captured by field workers directly while working and submitted to a server on cloud.  


### 5. Saved time for data analysis and making reports for programme coordinators
Avni has reduced the time and efforts for data analysis for programme coordinators. Various reports can be generated by a single click and can be downloaded in the format we want. Earlier, we used to analyse the data either in excel or SPSS and then write a report. Reports can even be accessed in the field where the network is available.

### 6. Improving the social status of MCHWs
Our workers already enjoyed good respect in the community because of the services provided by them. The digital tool in their hands and data at their fingertips is further improving their social status in the community.

Thus, the app deserves our attention not only for clinical and public health reason but for social and anthropological reasons as well.
