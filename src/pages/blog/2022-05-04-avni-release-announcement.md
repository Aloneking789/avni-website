### New features

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Multiple sync strategies
Now Avni provides multiple ways to sync a subject to the user's mobile device. By default subjects are synced based on 
their registered locations and this behaviour can be changed by changing "sync settings" under "advance settings" in the
subject type page. Read more about the feature and how to configure it in the [Avni readme](https://avni.readme.io/docs/sync-strategies).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Merging profile and general tab
If there are no programs, then separate tabs for the profile and general visit will not show. All the data will be visible
in one screen. 

Also in case of one Program or one Encounter setup for any subject type users will have the access to it in the main 
screen.

### Automatically approve the records during csv upload
If approval feature is enabled for any form, users can now auto approve the records by simply enabling the "Approve automatically"
checkbox during the csv upload.
