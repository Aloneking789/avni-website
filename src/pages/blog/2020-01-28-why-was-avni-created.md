  Generic open-source products bring a number of advantages to their customer
  than is immediately obvious, especially for the social sector. Here we make a
  case in favour of generic products.

Avni caters to field work across sectors and organisations. This is because there are a lot of similarities in the field work across sectors. Avni provides for all the similarities in the platform and provides tools to make the organisation specific things easier to implement. In other words is a generic software product that is configurable. So, how does Avni compare to other custom software solutions in use? To answer this, we must understand the broader picture of "software for social sector".

Lets breakup the potential customers of Avni (and adjacent products) into four segments.

1. Low in complexity; their need are shared with a large number of other organisations
2. High in complexity; need not similar to other customers
3. Everything in between 1 & 2 - in complexity and similarity
4. Large government projects (we will not discuss this one)

The first segment is well served by tools like ODK, KoboCollect, etc and they are also nearly free. In second segment the approach is usually to find a software service provider and develop custom solution. We will discuss this one in more detail later. The segment 3 needs were not satisfied because the tools like ODK do not meet their needs and the budgets and customer capacity are insufficient to develop a custom software. Avni neatly fits here because it lowers the cost and provides the features needed. Most of the Avni's current implementations fall here.

The tradeoffs involved in segment 2 are less well understood. When one compares a generic product like Avni with what is possible via a custom solution a few factors are missed out. What is obvious in custom solution is the following:

1. The organisation gets full control of all the features now and in future.
2. Since it is being built ground up it will be expensive to do so, but that is price of getting 1.

But there are a number of factors that are **not** obvious when making this decision.

1. A **generic product has institutional knowledge** of the domain, technology and users which is of significant value because it has been created by working with number of organisations in the same domain solving similar problem. This institutional knowledge provides advantage of lesser risk for the customer/user. In social sector the IT capacity on customer side are quite low to specify requirements, managing project, testing - which are significant source of risk.
2. Modern **generic products evolve (functionally and technically) even if the customer doesn't put any resources** into it, unlike a custom application.
3. **Generic products create ecosystems** around them which benefits everyone in it. For example - Avni makes it easy for an organisation to copy a module (like maternal health) from another customer's implementation and tweak it.

This is not to imply that one should never develop custom applications but that there are far more factors in favour of a generic product than meets the eye initially.
