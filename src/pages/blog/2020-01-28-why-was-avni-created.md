Avni caters to field work across sectors/domains. Perhaps there are other products in this category but I am not aware of them. But there are products in adjacent categories namely - community health and mobile data collection - which we believe is a more focussed case of field work. Hence, the question, how is Avni different from these platforms? Before we answer this question - let's step back and try to understand the broader picture of "software for social sector".

Lets breakup the potential customers of Avni (and adjacent products) into four segments.

1. Low complexity, common to large number of customers
2. High in complexity, not similar to other customers
3. Everything in between 1 & 2 - in complexity, similarity
4. Large government projects (we will not discuss this one)

The first segment is well served by tools like ODK, KoboCollect, etc and they are also nearly free. In second segment the approach is usually to find a software service provider and develop custom solution. We will discuss this one in more detail later. The segment 3 needs were not satisfied because the tools like ODK do not meet their needs and the budgets and customer capacity are insufficient to develop a custom software. Avni neatly fits here because it lowers the cost and provides the features needed. Most of the Avni's current implementations fall here.

The general advice for segment 1 is to check Avni if they are in doubt whether ODK etc would not satisfy their needs. Or in other words whether they actually below to segment 3. For this borderline cases the tradeoff is in  higher implementation (not field user) complexity to achieve more sophisticated use case.
