Working in a remote job fosters a unique enthusiasm to meet partners and team members face-to-face. The Avni Conference 2024 provided a platform for such interactions, allowing participants to understand each other better and strengthen their bonds. Meeting in person was a significant motivation for many attendees.

I started my journey from Bangalore at 4:00 am on January 20, 2024, amidst a period when flights across India were frequently delayed due to fog in the north. Fortunately, my flight to Goa was on time, and I reached the hotel without any issues.

The conference began with Vinay's session, where everyone introduced themselves and shared their favorite foods. I mentioned my fondness for paneer (cottage cheese). The Avni team then presented our accomplishments from 2023. Vinay highlighted the most critical work items and issues to ensure the discussion remained relevant and valuable for the NGO participants. This approach facilitated further discussions among participants about specific points of interest, making it easier for other NGOs to adopt new features both in terms of time and cost. Implementing an existing feature in another NGO's program requires significantly less effort than developing a new one.

Following this, each NGO showcased their work and how they were utilizing Avni in their programs. This segment was particularly interesting as it provided ideas for improving program implementation by expanding Avni's scope or modifying its usage.


After concluding the meeting around 6:00 pm, we planned to explore Goa and enjoy some leisure time. This casual interaction helped strengthen our connections further. The next morning, I woke up early and went to the beach with a few team members, as many were too tired from the previous night's activities. We enjoyed the beach and visited a nearby fort.

The meeting resumed at 10:00 am, with Vinay and Arjun demonstrating new features through the app. This practical showcase made it easier for clients to understand the features compared to reading documentation. The session was so engaging that the Swadhar team continued discussing until 2:00 pm, despite needing to leave by 1:30 pm.

The features showcase session was highly appreciated, and participants requested more frequent sessions of this nature. Each NGO provided a list of features they were interested in implementing to streamline their work processes further.

Thank you to all Avni conference participants for making the effort to travel and engage in these productive sessions. Hearing from partners about how Avni is helping them is incredibly motivating and encourages us to continue our good work.
